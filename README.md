# Capstone Project P2-DAIICT Placement Manager_Processing_Prodigies
Description:-

We have built a Placement Manager program for DAIICT, in which we have infused various Functions which eases the analysis of the placement process in our College.

We have a LINKED LIST Data structure to store all of the Data of the students after extracting it from a .csv file. We have further used Functions such as Sort and Search to help analyze the data in an efficient manner. We have also added certain more functions that give ideas about the placement statistics such as Mean, Median, Min-Max package etc. Using these placement Statistics information we have categorized the companies into Dream and Super dream companies. We have created a function named ‘acceptance rate’ that further helped us to create a ‘Trajectory’ that will guide the future batches for their placement.
